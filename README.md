# Image-Classification-Project
Continuous assessment for module "Hands-On Machine Learning".  Image classification project using keras, scikit-learn, numpy, pandas and plotmatlib. Deep learning project that classifies images as either 'sheep' or 'goat'. Use of 2D convolutional network and transfer learning models to produce high accuracy, minimal loss and lack of overfitting/underfitting. Project completed on Google Colab.
